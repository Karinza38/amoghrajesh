- ðŸ”­ I'm a Software Engineer based out of Bangalore, India. I am a Full Stack Developer with my interests lying in Web Development, Backend Development, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently focusing on Open Source Software and learning new technologies used in the industry which maybe of use to me at a later point in my career.

- ðŸŽ¶ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on any Open Source software that excites me. I will be more than happy to contribute to any Software that I use in my day to day life. In the end, giving back to the community is something that really matters.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach out to me on LinkedIn or through mail. All these profiles are attached in form of badges in this visual.

- âš¡ Fun(or not so Fun) Fact: Most of the developers jump to writing the code once they encounter a problem to solve. Nope. `First Solve the problem, then write the code for it`

- ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about Web Development, Machine Learning, and General Technology related queries.
